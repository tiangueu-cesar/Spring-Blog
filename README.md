# SPRING-BLOG
The Spring blog Post application consists of creating a simple post that includes a title and content. 
Prior to this, registration is required if the person does not already have an account or logs in directly using their credentials.   
After logging in, the person has direct access to their previously created posts, can create new posts and log out of their account.

**The application uses modern technologies like:** 

1. **Angular** on the frontend (routes, forms, Rxjs, Rest APIs, etc.) 

2. **Spring-boot** on the backend (Spring MVC, Spring Security, Rest APIs, Spring Data JPA, Mysql).
